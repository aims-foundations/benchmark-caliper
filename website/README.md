# Benchmark Caliper — Website

A public-facing interface to the validity-analysis pipeline. Now live at <https://aimslab.stanford.edu/benchmark-caliper/>. The full 7-step flow works end-to-end, and the privacy infrastructure (consent gate, retention cron, export/delete) is in place. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the security posture.

## What it does

A user pastes their Anthropic API key, uploads a benchmark paper PDF, and describes a deployment context. The site walks them through:

1. **Slug** — derive a short identifier (Haiku)
2. **Metadata** — extract benchmark metadata from pages 1–2 (Haiku)
3. **Elicitation questions** — generate 3–5 deployment-context questions (Sonnet)
4. **User answers** the questions in the browser
5. **Elicitation summary** — synthesize a structured summary (Sonnet)
6. **Email + mode** — user provides an email address and chooses auto (default) or step-by-step. By default the rest of the pipeline runs unattended and the user is emailed when the report is ready.
7. **Paper extraction** — per-page parallel Haiku fan-out + Sonnet consolidation
8. **Benchmark YAML** — Haiku picks ICL examples, Sonnet writes a per-paper YAML
9. **Region YAML** — Haiku picks templates, Sonnet writes a regional scaffold, Sonnet+web search enriches it
10. **Validity scoring** — single Opus call across the 6 dimensions
11. **Email delivery** — Resend sends the user a link to `/run/{run_id}` with the rendered Markdown report and raw JSON attached.

The final output is a 6-dimension validity report with per-dimension scores, reasoning, and evidence.

A typical end-to-end run for a 20-page paper costs roughly $1.50–$2.50 of Anthropic API spend at current rates (Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.7). Web search adds $10 per 1,000 searches on top of tokens.

## Running it locally

Requirements: Python 3.10+, Node 24+, an Anthropic API key.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (run from the repository root)
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r website/server/requirements.txt
python3 -m uvicorn website.server.app:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd website/client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. Vite proxies `/api/*` to <http://localhost:8000>.

> The backend uses package-relative imports, so it must be run as `website.server.app:app` from the **repository root** — not `app:app` from inside `website/server/`.

### Free local dev (no Anthropic spend)

For UI work and click-through testing without paying for API calls, set `MOCK_ANTHROPIC=1`. Every `call_text_async()` short-circuits to canned fixtures pulled from one already-paid assessment under `anthropic_api_package_release/assessments/`. Paste any string (e.g. `sk-ant-FAKE`) into the API-key field — the value is ignored.

```bash
MOCK_ANTHROPIC=1 python3 -m uvicorn website.server.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

The server prints a loud `⚠️  MOCK_ANTHROPIC=1` banner on startup and refuses to boot if any production signal is set (`ENV=production`, non-localhost `WEBSITE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). Override the fixture source with `MOCK_ANTHROPIC_FIXTURE=/abs/path/to/<expert>__<benchmark>/<slug>`. **Never set `MOCK_ANTHROPIC` in production** — leaving the variable unset (the default) is real mode. See [server/mock_anthropic.py](server/mock_anthropic.py).

---

## Testing

```bash
# backend (run from the repository root)
python3 -m pytest website/server/tests/

# frontend
cd website/client
npm test
```

All tests should pass (130 backend + 46 frontend = 176 total).

---

## Deployment

The site deploys as a single Docker service on Render. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the one-service setup and the AIMS proxy.
